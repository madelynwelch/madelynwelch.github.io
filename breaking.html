          <h5 class="card-title">Hatchell Resigns</h5>
          <p class="card-text">UNC announced women’s basketball head coach Sylvia Hatchell’s resignation late Thursday
            night. It came after the university investigated the program and placed the entire staff on administrative
            leave. UNC brought in a Charlotte law firm for the investigation and its report confirmed accusations that
            Hatchell made racially insensitive remarks and forced players to play through injuries.

            Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham released a statement just before midnight Thursday saying the university
            and Hatchell both concluded it was time for a change. He thanked her for 33 years of leading the program.

          <h5 class="card-title">Anti-semitic Rapper Comes to Campus</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Last week, we reported on the controversy surrounding Tamer Nafar, a Palestinian rapper.
            He performed on UNC’s campus March 22. It was part of a conference sponsored by the Center for Middle East
            and Islamic Studies. We noted that some audience members found his remarks on stage Anti-Semitic.

            Since then, his performance has gotten more publicity and backlash. Interim Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz was
            among those who criticized the performance. In a statement, Guskiewicz said he is “heartbroken and deeply
            offended that this performance happened.”

            Leaders of UNC Global, who hosted the conference, prohibited recording of the most controversial parts, but
            an audience member – a New York based conservative activist – secretly recorded it and released the video.

            students, after stopping in both Charlotte and Greensboro the same day. The Democrat from Texas is popular
            with young voters, but is that enough?</p>

  <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
